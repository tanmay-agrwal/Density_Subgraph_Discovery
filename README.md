# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Compilation

<br>

## Prerequisites
Ensure your system has the following:

- **Ubuntu Operating System**
- **GCC Compiler** (`gcc` installed)

---

<br>

## Compilation and Execution

In all the below commands, make sure to do the following:
- **REPLACE** the `"h_value"` with an appropriate integer value whose clique intensity you want to calculate
- And **REPLACE** the `"input_file.txt"` with the file name of the datasets as specified below:

| Dataset         | File Name                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| NetScience       | `NetScience.txt` |
| Yeast     | `Yeast.txt` |
| Ca      | `Ca.txt`  |

### 1) For Core Algorithm:

To compile and run the program-
```bash
g++ core.cpp -O2 -std=c++17
./a.out "input_file.txt" "h_value"
```


### 2) For Exact Algorithm:

To compile and run the program-
```bash
g++ exact.cpp -O2 -std=c++17
./a.out "input_file.txt" "h_value"
```
